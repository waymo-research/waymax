  The TrajectoryUpdate class contains the fields that a dynamics model is

  As all dynamics produce a TrajectoryUpdate (via the `compute_update` method),
  the TrajectoryUpdate serves as an intermediate update format that is common
  to all dynamics models. This allows handling of multiple agents using
  heterogeneous dynamics models.
