.. py:class:: WrongWayMetric


   Bases: :py:obj:`waymax.metrics.abstract_metric.AbstractMetric`

   Wrong-way metric for SDC.

   This metric checks if SDC is driving into wrong driving the wrong way or path.
   It first computes the distance to the closest roadgraph point in all valid
   paths that the SDC can drive along from its starting position. If the distance
   is larger than the threhold WRONG_WAY_THRES, it's considered wrong-way and
   returns the distance; otherwise, it's driving on the legal lanes, and returns
   0.0.

   .. py:attribute:: WRONG_WAY_THRES
      :value: 3.5

      

   .. py:method:: compute(simulator_state: waymax.datatypes.SimulatorState) -> waymax.metrics.abstract_metric.MetricResult

      Computes a per-timestep, per-object metric from a SimulatorState.

      :param simulator_state: The current simulator state of shape (...).

      :returns: A MetricResult containing the metric result and validity mask of shape
                (..., num_objects).



.. py:class:: OffroadMetric


   Bases: :py:obj:`waymax.metrics.abstract_metric.AbstractMetric`

   Offroad metric.

   This metric returns 1.0 if the object is offroad.

   .. py:method:: compute(simulator_state: waymax.datatypes.SimulatorState) -> waymax.metrics.abstract_metric.MetricResult

      Computes the offroad metric.

      :param simulator_state: Updated simulator state to calculate metrics for. Will
                              compute the offroad metric for timestep `simulator_state.timestep`.

      :returns:

                An array containing the metric result of the same shape as the input
                  trajectories. The shape is (..., num_objects).



.. py:function:: is_offroad(trajectory: waymax.datatypes.Trajectory, roadgraph_points: waymax.datatypes.RoadgraphPoints) -> jax.Array

   Checks if the given trajectory is offroad.

   This determines the signed distance between each bounding box corner and the
   closest road edge (median or boundary). If the distance is negative, then the
   trajectory is onroad else offroad.

   :param trajectory: Agent trajectories to test to see if they are on or off road of
                      shape (..., num_objects). The bounding boxes derived from center and shape
                      of the trajectory will be used to determine if any point in the box is
                      offroad.
   :param roadgraph_points: All of the roadgraph points in the run segment of shape
                            (..., num_points). Roadgraph points of type `ROAD_EDGE_BOUNDARY` and
                            `ROAD_EDGE_MEDIAN` are used to do the check.

   :returns: a bool array with the shape (..., num_objects). The value is
             True if the bbox is offroad.
   :rtype: agent_mask


.. py:function:: compute_signed_distance_to_nearest_road_edge_point(query_points: jax.Array, roadgraph_points: waymax.datatypes.RoadgraphPoints, z_stretch: float = 2.0) -> jax.Array

   Computes the signed distance from a set of queries to roadgraph points.

   :param query_points: A set of query points for the metric of shape
                        (num_query_points, 3).
   :param roadgraph_points: A set of roadgraph points of shape (num_points).
   :param z_stretch: Tolerance in the z dimension which determines how close to
                     associate points in the roadgraph. This is used to fix problems with
                     overpasses.

   :returns:

             Signed distances of the query points with the closest road edge points of
               shape (num_query_points). If the value is negative, it means that the
               actor is on the correct side of the road, if it is positive, it is
               considered `offroad`.
