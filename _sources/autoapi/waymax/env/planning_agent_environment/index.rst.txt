.. py:class:: PlanningAgentDynamics(multi_agent_dynamics: waymax.dynamics.DynamicsModel)


   Bases: :py:obj:`waymax.dynamics.DynamicsModel`

   A dynamics wrapper for converting multi-agent dynamics to single-agent.

   .. py:method:: action_spec() -> dm_env.specs.BoundedArray

      Action spec of the action containing the bounds.


   .. py:method:: compute_update(action: waymax.datatypes.Action, trajectory: waymax.datatypes.Trajectory) -> waymax.datatypes.TrajectoryUpdate

      Computes the pose and velocity updates at timestep.


   .. py:method:: forward(action: waymax.datatypes.Action, trajectory: waymax.datatypes.Trajectory, log_trajectory: waymax.datatypes.Trajectory, is_controlled: jax.Array, timestep: int, allow_new_objects: bool = True) -> waymax.datatypes.Trajectory

      Updates a simulated trajectory to the next timestep given an update.

      Runs the forward model for the planning agent by taking in a single object's
      action and tiling it for all others and then running the wrapped action.

      :param action: Actions to be applied to the trajectory to produce updates at the
                     next timestep of shape (..., dim).
      :param trajectory: Simulated trajectory up to the current timestep. This
                         trajectory will be updated by this function updated with the trajectory
                         update. It is expected that this trajectory will have been updated up to
                         `timestep`. This is of shape: (..., num_objects, num_timesteps).
      :param log_trajectory: Logged trajectory for all objects over the entire run
                             segment. Certain fields such as valid are optionally taken from this
                             trajectory. This is of shape: (..., num_objects, num_timesteps).
      :param is_controlled: Boolean array specifying which objects are to be controlled
                            by the trajectory update of shape (..., num_objects).
      :param timestep: Timestep of the current simulation.
      :param allow_new_objects: Whether to allow new objects to enter the secene. If
                                this is set to False, all objects that are not valid at the current
                                timestep will not be valid at the next timestep and visa versa.

      :returns:

                Updated trajectory given update from a dynamics model at `timestep` + 1
                  of shape (..., num_objects, num_timesteps).


   .. py:method:: inverse(trajectory: waymax.datatypes.Trajectory, metadata: waymax.datatypes.ObjectMetadata, timestep: int) -> waymax.datatypes.Action

      Computes actions converting traj[timestep] to traj[timestep+1].

      Runs the wrapped dynamics inverse and slices out the sdc's action
      specifically.

      :param trajectory: Full trajectory to compute the inverse actions from of shape
                         (..., num_objects, num_timesteps). This trajectory is for the entire
                         simulation so that dynamics models can use sophisticated otpimization
                         techniques to find the best fitting actions.
      :param metadata: Metadata on all objects in the scene which contains information
                       about what types of objects are in the scene of shape (...,
                       num_objects).
      :param timestep: Current timestpe of the simulation.

      :returns:

                Action which will take a set of objects from trajectory[timestep] to
                  trajectory[timestep + 1] of shape (..., num_objects, dim).



.. py:class:: PlanningAgentEnvironment(dynamics_model: waymax.dynamics.DynamicsModel, config: waymax.config.EnvironmentConfig, sim_agent_actors: Sequence[waymax.agents.actor_core.WaymaxActorCore] = ())


   Bases: :py:obj:`waymax.env.base_environment.BaseEnvironment`

   An environment wrapper allowing for controlling a single agent.

   The PlanningAgentEnvironment inherits from a multi-agent BaseEnvironment
   to build a single-agent environment by returning only the observations and
   rewards corresponding to the ego-agent (i.e. ADV).

   Note that while the action and reward no longer have an obj dimension as
   expected for a single agent env, the observation retains the obj dimension
   set to 1 to conform with the observation datastructure.

   .. py:method:: metrics(state: waymax.datatypes.SimulatorState) -> waymax.env.typedefs.Metrics

      Computes the metrics for the single agent wrapper.

      The metrics to be computed are based on those specified by the configuration
      passed into the environment. This runs metrics that may be specific to the
      planning agent case.

      :param state: State of simulation to compute the metrics for. This will compute
                    metrics for the timestep corresponding to `state.timestep` of shape
                    (...).

      :returns:

                Dictionary from metric name to metrics.MetricResult which represents the
                  metrics calculated at `state.timestep`. All metrics assumed to be shaped
                  (..., num_objects=1) unless specified in the metrics implementation.


   .. py:method:: reward(state: waymax.datatypes.SimulatorState, action: waymax.datatypes.Action) -> jax.Array

      Computes the reward for a transition.

      :param state: State of simulation to compute the metrics for. This will compute
                    reward for the timestep corresponding to `state.timestep` of shape
                    (...).
      :param action: The action applied for the state.

      :returns: A float (...) tensor of rewards for the single agent.


   .. py:method:: action_spec() -> waymax.datatypes.Action

      Returns the action specs of the environment without batch dimension.

      :returns:

                The action specs represented as a PyTree where the leaves
                  are instances of specs.Array.


   .. py:method:: step(state: waymax.datatypes.SimulatorState, action: waymax.datatypes.Action) -> waymax.datatypes.SimulatorState

      Advances simulation by one timestep using the dynamics model.

      :param state: The current state of the simulator of shape (...).
      :param action: The action to apply, of shape (..., num_objects). The
                     actions.valid field is used to denote which objects are being controlled
                     - objects whose valid is False will fallback to default behavior
                     specified by self.dynamics.

      :returns: The next simulation state after taking an action of shape (...).


   .. py:method:: reward_spec() -> dm_env.specs.Array

      Specify the reward spec as just for one object.



.. py:function:: _initialized_overlap(log_trajectory: waymax.datatypes.Trajectory) -> jax.Array

   Return a mask for objects initialized in a overlap state.

   This function returns a boolean mask indicating if an object is in a
   overlap state at timestep 0 in the logged trajectory. This function
   can be used to prune out certain objects that are initialized in an
   overlap, such as articulated buses and pedestrians in a PUDO situation.

   :param log_trajectory: A trajectory of shape (..., num_objects, num_timesteps).

   :returns: A [..., objects] boolean tensor of overlap masks.
